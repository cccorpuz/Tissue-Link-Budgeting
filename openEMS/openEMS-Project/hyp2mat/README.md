# hyp2mat

hyp2mat is a utility which converts HyperLynx and [QucsStudio](http://dd6um.darc.de/QucsStudio/qucsstudio.html) pcb files to matlab for electromagnetic simulation, or to PDF for printing.

hyp2mat is distributed with [openEMS](http://www.openems.de), a free open-source electromagnetic field solver.

## Installation

hyp2mat can be installed from pre-compiled binaries, or compiled from source:

* [Windows binaries](http://www.kdvelectronics.eu/hyp2mat/hyp2mat-win32-current.zip)
* To install from source see the file INSTALL for compilation instructions
